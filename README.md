# GhostSys Demo
This is a prototype build, a preview of a larger project in development. It’s designed to test core functions and explore what’s possible within the system. The .BAS file is compatible with both QBASIC and QB64.

A retro-inspired, text-driven puzzle defence game designed in classic DOS aesthetics and built with the BASIC Programming Language.

Find the password to unlock the system, before directories are spawned with junk files.

Explore randomized layouts and file structures.
